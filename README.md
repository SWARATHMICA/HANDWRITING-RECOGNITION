# Handwriting Recognition with BPN Algorithm
# Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates a handwriting recognition task using a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPN). The notebook is structured into multiple sections covering data loading, preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and result visualization.

# Sections
Importing Necessary Libraries:
The notebook imports essential libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib. It also connects to Google Colab for file handling and resource access.

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to make it ready for training the neural network. The notebook contains code to load the dataset and clean/preprocess it.

BPN Algorithm Implementation:
This section implements the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPN) algorithm, setting up the architecture and defining the necessary parameters for training.

Error and Weight Convergence Plots:
The notebook generates plots that display error convergence and weight convergence during the training process.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
Google Colab (if running on the cloud)

# Dataset 
This model has been trained on image dataset of Handwriting images of Uppercase letters. This dataset consists of 40 images only; 36- S and 4- non S. Train the model according to your requirements.

# How to Use
Run the notebook: Follow the cells in sequence to execute the necessary steps.
Upload the dataset: Ensure that you upload the dataset when prompted, as the notebook loads data during execution.

# Results
The notebook will generate various plots that visualize the convergence of errors and weights, helping to evaluate the performance of the BPN model.

# Note
This model has been trained to predict only Uppercase S
